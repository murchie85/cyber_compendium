## NIST FRAMEWORK 

On February 12th 2013, president Obama issued executive order **13636** to improve **critical infrastructure cyber security**. One year later NIST released a voluntary framework, which can be considered as a living/evolving document.
This differs from other compliance such as PCI, HIPAA - this is a general overview framework that is relevant hierarchically for all people form all backgrounds. The idea is to help people organize their thoughts and strategies to better improve communication and cyber security posture.

This innovation behind the strategy is broken down into few core pillars, **identify**, **protect**, **detect**, **respond** and **recover**.  

**.Identification**. is highly important in areas such as mergers, new onboarding and acquisitions when you don’t know what you are getting.  We spend a lot of time inside our own networks  scanning and discovering new devices, not just assets under our management but also assets that don’t belong on our network.
